I have done all the points of this task! 
when i tried to merge the branches, i had some conflict so i had to fix them and **i did**.
what about ** 14,15,16 ** i was a little bit confused because i had two ideas:
first one, add images to the folder "images" and indicate the path to them,
or , indicate a url to a certain image on the internet ,so i choosed the second choice,
i have configured S3 Bucket on AWS and made the image public.
Finally, if something does not meet the requirements, i am ready to redo the task.
