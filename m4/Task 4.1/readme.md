# Part 1

##### 1,2. 
    I have created project which include 4 PC and one Hub

##### 3.  
    For all PC I added an ip addresses and masks

##### 4,5,6.  
    I have checked performance the network. Sended the ICMP packets from one PC to other. Then I moved to the simulation mode. Using start/stop button I runned ICMP packets
![ICMP](https://github.com/shizgara/DevOps_online_Rivne_2020Q42021Q1/blob/master/m4/Task%204.1/images/4%2C5%2C6%2C%20pdu.png)
##### 7.  
    I have looked the information about the packets from the Simulation Panel window

##### 8.  
    I have deleted an ip address from pc0-pc3 and made a conclusion - data transfer is not possible without ip addresses

##### 9,10,11.  
    I have created a new project which include five PC's, two Hubs and one Server.
![2 Hubs](https://github.com/shizgara/DevOps_online_Rivne_2020Q42021Q1/blob/master/m4/Task%204.1/images/9%2C10%2C11.png)
##### 12,13.  
    Than I created a project which include four PC's and one Switch. The traffic is forwarded from the port to the destination. By sending traffic out of only one port to the destination, other ports are not affected, which saves the bandwidth.

##### 14,15,16,17.  
![2Switch](https://github.com/shizgara/DevOps_online_Rivne_2020Q42021Q1/blob/master/m4/Task%204.1/images/14-15.png)
![IP](https://github.com/shizgara/DevOps_online_Rivne_2020Q42021Q1/blob/master/m4/Task%204.1/images/16.png)
![ICMP](https://github.com/shizgara/DevOps_online_Rivne_2020Q42021Q1/blob/master/m4/Task%204.1/images/17.png)
##### 18-23.  
    Pcs can ping each other because router connects two networks.
